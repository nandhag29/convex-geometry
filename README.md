Code explorations for LEMMA project "Computational Convex Geometry and Geometric Probability"

Initial explorations in sampling from random distributions and seeing the expected values of various properties of the convex hull (perimeter, diameter, area, vertices)

Final project aims to optimize a method to find the John ellipsoid in the 2nd and possibly 3rd dimensions
